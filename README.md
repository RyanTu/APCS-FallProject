Project Description
======
This project is meant to create a simpler version of Plants vs. Zombies.

Installation
======
1. Clone the folder
2. Compile "Driver.java"
3. Run Driver

Use
======
After running the program, start by clicking the "Start" button. Then, choose the plant option you want in the radio buttons and place it on the grid by clicking in that space. The pea shooters shoot objects at incoming zombies while the chomper will eat the zombie in the panel to the right with a delay. The game ends either when you defeat a number of zombies or when a zombie reaches all the way to the left side of the field. You can then click the "Reset" button to clear the board and click "Start" to begin again.

Images were obtained from the Internet from PopCap's Plants vs. Zombies.
